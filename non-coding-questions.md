#### Coding part

When giving coding challenges I also set the following expectations with the candidate
  - start with getting something that works, then iterate your way toward a solution you would be
    happy to deploy to production
  - you should have tests
  - the onus is on you to prove to me your solution works. I will not check your code to make sure it works.
