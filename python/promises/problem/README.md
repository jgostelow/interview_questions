# promises

## Overview

This contains a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) library for Python.  You should try to implement the following methods:

- Promise.all(cls)
- Promise.race(cls)
- Promise.resolve(cls)
- Promise.reject(cls)
- Promise()
- Promise.then(self)
- Promise.catch(self)
- Promise.p_finally(self)

However, don't worry about finishing the problem - it's designed to take more time than we have.

The functions you need to work on are in `promises/promise.py`.

There are some tests for you already; you can run `make test` to test your code and see progress.
