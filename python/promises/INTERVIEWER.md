# Overview

The goal of this exercise is to test a candidate's Python knowledge, problem solving ability, and their ability to dive into how things work.

The candidate will be expected to implement a library for [promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) in Python.

It's important to note: **the exercise is designed to take longer than 30 minutes.**  Be upfront with the candidate about this - it's expected that they won't finish, so there's no shame in leaving parts of the project undone.

## Setup

To get things ready for the candidate, go to `interview-coding-problems/python/promises` and run `make fresh-solution`.  There will be a copied set of files in the `solution` directory.  Then, cd into `solution` and run `make test` to verify that things are working (the tests should all fail).  Then, create a branch for the candidate, in the format `interview-<first initial><last name>-YYYY-MM-DD`.
