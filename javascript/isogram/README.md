# Expected time

10-20 minutes

# Things to look for

1. Comfort with manipulating strings and arrays.
2. Understanding the function needs to return a boolean.

# Follow up questions

If there's time, some things to think about:

- How could we make this method available on all strings?
    - (looking for some awareness of prototype-based inheritance, not necessarily knowing all the details)
    - Can you think of reasons we might NOT want to make this method available on all strings?

- What additional test cases could be useful?
    - (non-letter characters, hyphens, e.g.)
