# Interview Coding problems

## What is it?

This is a collection of small coding problems with the following goals:

* Selects for basic coding skills and logic
* Does not select for in-depth knowledge of APIs
* Does not select for prior knowledge of sorting algorithms
* Self-documenting.  Test cases should be the acceptance criteria
* Suitable for pairing scenarios where candidate is behind keyboard, and interviewer is coaching/observing.


## Expected time to complete

A good coding problem in this style should be achievable in 10-30 minutes of work.  Completing the problem is ideal, but the important aspect is understanding the candidate's thinking style and approach to solving the problem.
